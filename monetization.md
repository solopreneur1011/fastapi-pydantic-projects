### Cost Estimates to Set Up Each Project

Setting up these projects primarily involves free open-source tools like FastAPI and Pydantic (which is free under MIT license, with no framework costs for Pydantic AI based on available info). The AI agents will likely require an LLM backend—I'm assuming xAI's Grok API for this, which is pay-as-you-go with no upfront fees (e.g., $0.20-$3.00 per million input tokens, $0.50-$15.00 per million output tokens depending on the model; initial testing might cost under $1 for a few queries). Hosting can use Vercel's free Hobby tier (up to 1M requests/month, 100GB bandwidth), and databases like PostgreSQL via Supabase's free tier (500MB storage).

Initial "setup costs" here refer to one-time or first-month expenses for infrastructure, API keys, and basic deployment (e.g., domain registration if desired, ~$15/year via GoDaddy). Most are $0 if you stick to free tiers and local development, with costs scaling on usage (e.g., API calls). I've assumed minimal viable setup: local dev, deploy to free cloud hosting, optional bonuses not included unless core. No labor/dev time costs included. If using paid web search tools (e.g., for Project 1), add $50/month for something like SerpAPI starter— but free alternatives exist.

| Project | Estimated Initial Setup Cost | Breakdown & Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Durable AI Research Assistant API | $0-$16 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0 (free tier).<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0 upfront, ~$0.50-$1 for initial test calls.<br>- Web search tools: $0 if using free options (e.g., custom scraping); $50/month if paid like SerpAPI.<br>- Bonus Temporal: $0 (open-source self-host) or $500/month if using Temporal Cloud Business plan (avoid for setup; use startup credits if eligible for $6,000 free).<br>- Optional domain: $15/year.<br>Neat for reliability, but long-running tasks could incur LLM token costs quickly. |
| 2. Personal AI Task Manager with Tools | $0-$20 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0.<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0-$1 for tests.<br>- Tools: Weather API (OpenWeather): $0 (free tier up to 1M calls/month).<br>- Reminders (SMS via Twilio): $0 upfront, $0.0083 + $0.0025-$0.005 per message (pay-per-use; test 10 messages ~$0.10).<br>- Email API (e.g., SendGrid): $0 (free tier up to 100 emails/day).<br>- Calendar APIs (e.g., Google): $0.<br>- Bonus frontend (Streamlit/React): $0 (local/host on Vercel free).<br>- Optional domain: $15/year.<br>Practical, but SMS usage adds up for real users. |
| 3. Movie/TV Recommendation Agent API | $0-$17 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0.<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0-$1 for tests.<br>- APIs: TMDB $0 (free); OMDb $0 (free with 1,000 calls/day) or $1/month donation for 100k calls/day via Patreon.<br>- Bonus DB (Supabase PostgreSQL): $0 (free tier 500MB).<br>- Optional domain: $15/year.<br>Fun project; stay in free API limits for zero cost. |
| 4. AI-Powered Code Review Tool | $0-$16 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0.<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0-$1 for tests (code analysis uses more tokens).<br>- GitHub API: $0 (free with rate limits).<br>- File handling: $0 (built-in).<br>- Optional domain: $15/year.<br>Useful for devs; no extra APIs needed. |
| 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration Dashboard | $0-$16 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0.<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0-$1 for tests (multi-agents could use more calls).<br>- MCP/agent comms: $0 (framework-free).<br>- Bonus dashboard: $0 (host on Vercel).<br>- Optional domain: $15/year.<br>Cutting-edge; scale carefully to avoid high LLM costs. |
| 6. Simple URL Shortener with AI Features | $0-$16 | - Hosting (Vercel): $0.<br>- LLM (xAI API): $0-$1 for tests (for smart codes/summaries).<br>- DB (Supabase): $0 (free tier).<br>- Analytics/charts (Matplotlib/Plotly): $0.<br>- Optional domain: $15/year (useful for shorteners).<br>Simple to start; AI twist is low-cost. |

**Overall Tips**: Total for all 6 could be $0 if skipping domains and using free tiers, or ~$100 if adding basics like domains and small API donations/tests. Upgrade to paid hosting/DB ($20-25/month each) for production traffic. Costs rise with usage (e.g., LLM tokens at scale: 1M input/output tokens ~$0.20-$15). Deploy via Docker to Vercel/Heroku for free. If you qualify as a startup, apply for Temporal/xAI credits to offset. Need more details on a specific project or alternative providers?
